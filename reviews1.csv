Bhrigu Lake is a high altitude lake located in the Kullu District. It is situated at an altitude of 4300 meters above sea level and is a part of Himachal Pradesh, North India.There are mainly 2 routes to reach Bhrigu Lake, the first one starts from Gulaba and from here trekker has to cover about 6 km on foot then one reach at Bhrigu lake. Due to lack of time, most people reach the lake by this route. The second path starts from Vashisth Kund. There is a hot water spring in Vashisth, most trekkers who go through this route take a bath in a hot spring and reach the holy lake. Travelers have to face the steep climb up to the lake by this route. The walking distance of the lake from Vashisth is about 14 km.I started trekking from Solang Valley and did a loop of 39 km. We did it in a single day, which usually takes 2-3 days. I had a local boy with whom I did this trek. We started the trek from the camp site at 07:30 in the morning, walking at a speed we soon reached Gulaba from where the steep climb started for the lake. By crossing the first two campsites we reached 4000 meters in about two and a half hours, snow had started from here and the weather started getting worse.We kept moving forward without reducing the speed, but in the end, it was about one or two km where we lost our day in zero visibility. There was an empire of mist here, it was not possible to see anything. After wandering here and there for a long time, we finally reached Bhrigu Lake at 11:30am.Last winter there was a lot of snowfall in the entire Himalayan range, which was evidenced by the lake itself. It was third week of July, yet the lake is still semi frozen. Not much was seen in bad weather, yet we got a clear view of the lake. The temple of local goddess located nearby was also seen.This lake is situated at an altitude of 4300 meters. This lake is located in the famous mountain range Pir Panjal. It is said that here sage Bhrigu had done meditation here in ancient times, this lake was named Bhrigu after his name. This lake is very famous among the locals and Hindu's for its purity. People come here barefoot and worship.After seeing the lake, we soon started descending towards Vashisth Kund. The gradient was full down steep, yet both of us ran 14 km.

Therefore, the government is stressing on setting up a ropeway between Kothi village which is in Manali and Rohtang Pass. The NGT (National Green Tribunal) has asked the state government of Himachal Pradesh to complete all the formalities to start a ropeway. With the coming of a ropeway, we can reduce carbon emission from vehicles. Heavy snowfall blocks the road in winter and a ropeway will be very useful.[11]As the pass gets blocked by snow and the road over the pass closes from November to May rendering Lahaul and Spiti districts north of the pass inaccessible, a need was felt to build a tunnel under the pass. The project was announced by the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 3 June 2000. The work was started by BRO on 6 May 2002. The foundation stone of the project was laid on 28 June 2010 by Sonia Gandhi in her capacity as the Chairperson of National Advisory Council. The road tunnel called Atal Tunnel has been excavated and became operational on 3 October 2020 after formal inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It obviates the need to travel over the Rohtang Pass. While it takes 4 to 6 hours to ascend, negotiate and descend the Rohtang Pass, travel through the Rohtang Tunnel takes only about 30 minutes.The pass provides a natural divide between the Kullu Valley with a primarily sanatani culture (in the south), and the arid high-altitude Lahaul and Spiti valleys with a Buddhist culture (in the north). The pass lies on the watershed between the Chenab and Beas basins. On the southern side of this pass, the Beas River emerges from underground and flows southward[6] and on its northern side, the Chandra River (flows from the eastern Himalayas), a source stream of the river Chenab, flows westward.Sometimes travelling to Rohtang Pass is difficult.

As you make your way through the dense coffee plantations and verdant forests, the sound of the gushing water becomes more prominent, building up anticipation. Upon reaching the falls, you're greeted with a sight that instantly captivates you. The sheer volume and force of the water plunging into the rocky pool below create a symphony of sights and sounds, leaving you in awe of nature's raw power.The beauty of Abbey Falls is further enhanced by the lush vegetation that surrounds it. The area is rich in diverse flora and fauna, adding to the overall charm of the place. The vibrant greenery and the misty atmosphere create a mystical ambiance that makes it a photographer's paradise. It's hard not to be enchanted by the ethereal beauty that Abbey Falls exudes.To truly appreciate the grandeur of Abbey Falls, it is recommended to visit during the monsoon season when the waterfall is at its fullest.

Considering the crowded peaks like Netravati peak and others this place is still unknown heaven. on Saturday we saw hardly 50people climbed the peak all together. So before it becomes fish market visit and have fun.- In case if you are traveling from other city and I would recommend you to stay in Agraharam Resort which is just in front of the base.- There is a KTDC office at the base they will charge 2360 per 5 person and 500/additional person. We were 9 of us and we paid 4360. In case if you go only 2/3 then they will charge min 2k. They allow people from 7.30AM. I would suggest carry some bread or any snacks and leave by 7.30 itself. So that you will return the base by 1/2 pm Max and can have lunch and rest.- they will send one guide with you and he will be with you throughout the trek until you reach back the same place. Elephants use to come in this region very frequently hence guide would be helpful to handle the situation. So in case in half way someone wanted to come back then he will either take all of you down or go up together.-We went on 1st July Saturday and frequent mild drizzling was there and heavily rained in previous days. So leeches are inevitable and the KTDC guy failed to warn us. I was very unhappy with this. We were under severe leech attack and none of us had experience before. But there and many precautions available in Google so follow that and nothing to worry- The total stretch would be around 6-7km one way and you will have leech issues only till 3rd km. After that more open areas and you can walk relax. First 4 km will have proper path way to let the forest rangesrs jeep to travel. So it would be comfortable easy walk until 4th km.there is where you will find watch tower. You can sit there and relax for as much as you want.very nice place and anyone who doesn't have Trekking experience can come till here so easily.-Aftwr this watch tower is the real Trekking starts narrow foot path covered with full of well grown grass.The views waht you see from here will make you feel like flying and never feel tired. In 45mins to 1 hour you could reach the peak. You sit there take photos and spend some time. The peak is exactly the Kerala/Karnataka border. It took just 75mins for us to return the base it was real quick.Fees: 2360 for 5. In case if you go only 2/3 people then min they will charge 2k.Recommended activities

The lush landscapes, breathtaking vistas, and the sense of accomplishment at the summit made it an unforgettable experience. The trail is well-marked and offers a perfect balance of challenges and rewards.While leeches were present on the trail, it added an element of adventure and reminded me of the raw beauty of nature. The serenity of the surroundings and the fresh mountain air created a serene atmosphere, perfect for introspection and rejuvenation. The knowledgeable guides added depth to the journey with their insights into the local flora, fauna, and cultural significance. Reaching the peak, I was rewarded with panoramic views that stretched to the horizon.The descent was equally invigorating, and the memories of this trek will forever hold a special place in my heart.Visited this place during July last week and it was raining. There was only one other trekking team with us. It gave a quiet surrounding.Recommended activities

The beach was overcrowded and it felt like a commercialized money-making venture rather than a tranquil escape.You are forced to decide and pay for pay for the water sports activity even before seeing the beach or the rights of the facilities for that matter. Moreover, there is a cancellation amount charged if you change your mind. In case you are going in a larger group and the other members do not want to participate in the water sports, they would be held hostages for 3 to 4 hours till the rest of the members finish the activities. No one informed us about the time limit of the speed boat that takes you to the beach. Unfortunately it started raining and activities like paragliding took a pause due to which we took longer than expected time to return back and we were charged 10000 rupees extra. The toilet facility there is also extremely unhygienic for which they also take a charge of 10 rs. Moreover, if you are considering to take a water sport, you will be compared to take up a locker which is going to cost you another 100 rs. In short, it is a money making scam. After doing all this even the rides were very disappointing the there was no information given what so ever about the corals, fishes and the marine life. After promising for a 45 minute sea walk they wrapped the sea walk in literally 10 to 12 minutes. If you still want to experience the rides here please come prepared with your swimming clothes, towels and a set of dry clothes.To add to the disappointment, the rain started pouring down, leaving us with no shelter or refuge. The food options were limited and shockingly overpriced, making it an even more disheartening experience.Please think twice before considering this beach as a part of your itinerary for Andaman.

The construction continued for the next three years and was completed in 1612 under the supervision of Viceroy Ruy Tavara. The word Aguada means freshwater in Portuguese language and the fort derives its name from a freshwater spring located within it. It is recorded that crews of sailing ships used to replenish their stock of potable water from this spring.Aguada Fort was built to guard and defend the Portuguese stronghold in Goa against the Maratha and Dutch invaders. Owing to its location at the confluence of the Arabian Sea and the Mandovi River, it became the most prized fortress for the Portuguese back in the seventeenth century.In 1864, a four-storied lighthouse was erected within the fort’s premises. For a long time after that, the fort served as a reference point for the ships and vessels sailing in from Europe, thanks to the lighthouse. In 1976, the lighthouse was finally abandoned and it is currently closed to the public. However, there is a new lighthouse built in the fort premises, which is called the Aguada Lighthouse. Interestingly, the fort premises also houses a jail which was actively used during the administration of the 100th prime minister of Portugal, called Salazar. It is one of those few forts in India that has never been conquered by an enemy.Fort Aguada ArchitectureAguada Fort is a splendid example of the Portuguese military style of architecture. It was constructed using laterite stone, which was found in abundance in Goa. The fort is categorized into two parts – the upper part and the lower part. The upper part was designed to serve as a fort and a huge watering station. The lower part extended a safe berth for the ships belonging to the Portuguese rulers. The fort is enveloped by walls as high as 5 meters and as wide as 1.3 meters. There are bastions that surround the fort on three sides while the fourth side has a gateway that faces the Mandovi River.In its heydays, Aguada Fort served as one of the largest freshwater storages of Asia and had the capacity to store 2,376,Visited on

The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha (holy vessel) was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple.The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The Peshwas donated the village of Mangeshi to the temple in 1739 on the suggestion of their Sardar, Shri Ramchandra Malhar Sukhtankar, who was a staunch follower of Shri Mangesh. Just a few years after it was built, this area too fell into Portuguese hands in 1763,[5] but by now, the Portuguese had lost their initial religious zeal and had become quite tolerant of other religions, and so, this structure remained untouched.Wait time

This place also served the purpose of a prison. Until recently it wasn’t open to the public. This fort has been opened for public view in the month of June 2012.In the year of 2007, the Government of Goa signed a tripartite agreement with INTACH and the Helen Hamlyn Trust.

People normally flock to one end of the lake which is famous for its sunset view, incredible food stalls, and the view of the lake, in general. There are also boat tours to the islands on this artificial lake or just normal sunset rides.Parking:Parking is a nightmare in the tourist area, because the roads are narrow and already filled with tourists or locals. You can either park at the far ends of the road but that would mean a walk of 10-15 mins depending on where you are standing/sitting.Food:Indulge in delicious local food where you can try the chaats, momos, North Indian fare, South Indian fare, Mumbai-special food, Delhi-special food all on the same stretch of road. The options are aplenty and you can sit wherever you like. Just be wary of restaurant owners trying their best to woo you. Don't fall for their sweet words and sit only where you feel like sitting.Activities:Boat rides, horse rides, and camel rides are the norm.

No worry for food and snacks, other shikara with full amenities will come to your shikara. Also several outlets are present in Dal lake. Additionally, one can bring their own item also on shikara.4. Any souvenir items, prefer to take from road side market which gets active in the evening at outside lake.5. For photography, prefer to take soft copy (40 to 50 rs per copy) as it is much cheaper than hardcopy.6.

The pass, at 4,310 m (14,140 ft), connects the towns of Kalimpong and Gangtok to the villages and towns of the lower Chumbi Valley.The pass was surveyed by J. W. Edgar in 1873, who described the pass as being used for trade by Tibetans. Francis Younghusband used the pass in 1903–04, as did a diplomatic British delegation to Lhasa in 1936–37, and Ernst Schäfer in 1938–39. In the 1950s, trade in the Kingdom of Sikkim utilized this pass. Diplomatically sealed by China and India after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, the pass saw skirmishes between the two countries in coming years, including the clashes in 1967 which resulted in fatalities on both sides. Nathu La has often been compared to Jelep La, a mountain pass situated at a distance of 3 miles (4.8 km).The next few decades saw an improvement in ties leading to the re-opening of Nathu La in 2006. The opening of the pass provides an alternative route to the pilgrimage of Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar, and was expected to bolster the economy of the region by playing a key role in the growing Sino-Indian trade. However, while trade has had a net positive impact, it under-performed, and is limited to specific types of goods and to specific days of the week. Weather conditions including heavy snowfall restricts border trade to around 7 to 8 months.Roads to the pass have been improved on both sides. Rail routes have been brought closer. It is part of the domestic tourist circuit in south-east Sikkim. Soldiers from both sides posted at Nathu La are among the closest along the entire Sino-India border. It is also one of the five Border Personnel Meeting points between the two armies of both countries. 2020 border tensions and the coronavirus pandemic have affected tourism and movement across the pass.Nathu La is a mountain pass in the Dongkya Range of the Himalayas between China's Yadong County in Tibet, and the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal in Bengal, South Asia.

It lies at an altitude of 2590 meters and at a distance of 13 kilometres away from Darjeeling.The wonderful view of snow-capped mountains sitting among cotton clouds draws in tourists to Tiger Hill from throughout the country. Surprisingly, this is also the summit of Ghoom, which is the highest railway station in the Darjeeling Himalayan Train, a UNESCO Globe Heritage Site.This vista point of Tiger Hill is a pristine natural beauty where you can enjoy the virgin charm of Darjeeling in its most captivating form. At sunrise, the peaks of Kanchenjunga are lit up before the sunlight is seen anywhere else in the city, which is an amazing thing to experience. Another notable point of admiration here is the natural beauty of Tiger Hill, which is covered in mild verdant foliage paired with sublime clouds in the background. The fresh morning air as you make your way to the summit is a refreshing experience away from the banter of city life.The Hill has an enormous height of 8,482 feet and looks delightful during the sunset and sunrise. Each day, countless tourists can be spotted visiting this amazing mountain range in Darjeeling. It is known for its mesmerizing beauty. During the sunrise, as the first ray of the sun falls on it, the white peaks illuminate. Similarly, the colour of the white peaks’ changes to peach during the sunset.  People can also witness the striking panoramic view of Mt. Everest as well. From Tiger Hill, Mount Everest (8848m) is just visible. Makalu (8481m) looks higher than Mt. Everest, owing to the curvature of the Earth, as it is several miles closer than Everest.Tiger Hill is at a distance of 13 kilometres from the city and can be easily accessed through roads from Darjeeling. The nearby major train terminal to Tiger hill is Siliguri Junction Train Station which is 33 kilometres away. A one and a half-hour long journey from The Elgin, Darjeeling will surely be worth it when you are taken aback by the awe-inspiring views of the Himalayas and the sun rising behind these glorious mountains. There are roads leading up to the base of the hill that can be navigated using a jeep with Chowrasta, Alubari or Jorebangla. Hereafter, there is a summit that has to be covered on foot.It has always been very pleasant to see the beauty of the sunrise from Tiger Hill. Also, you may enjoy the beautiful view of Kanchenjunga, and it’s always pleasant to see. Sun rise from the valley is ultimate experience one who visited. To visit sun rise you have to wok up early in the morning at 4 AM and process for Tiger Hill. There is too much crowed if you get late and you wont be able to reach there.

However, my recent visit left me with mixed feelings, highlighting the need for better attention and management.First, the positives. The view from Tiger Hill is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Watching the sunrise paint the sky with hues of orange and pink while the mighty Kanchenjunga stands tall is an experience that's hard to put into words. It's a sight that should be on every traveler's bucket list.That said, the visit could be more enjoyable with some improvements. The crowd here can be overwhelming, and I couldn't help but worry about safety. Authorities should consider better crowd management measures before an unmonitored crowd leads to accidents.Additionally, the entry ticket system seems reasonable, but it could be more organized to reduce waiting times.One major downside during my visit was the ongoing construction of an observatory building, which added to the frustration. It obstructed the view and disrupted the otherwise tranquil atmosphere. I hope that once completed, it enhances the overall experience rather than detracting from it.Lastly, a piece of advice for future visitors: the view is undoubtedly great, but it can be hindered by bad weather. It's essential to check the weather forecast before planning an early morning visit, as often suggested by tourist guides. Mother Nature can be unpredictable, and fog or rain can obscure the panoramic views.In conclusion, Tiger Hill's natural beauty is undeniable, and the sunrise view is a must-see. However, there's room for improvement in crowd management, ticketing, and minimizing construction-related disruptions. Visitors should be mindful of weather conditions for the best experience. With some attention and proper management, Tiger Hill can continue to be a memorable destination for all.Tiger Hill in Darjeeling is undoubtedly famous for its breathtaking sunrise view and the stunning sight of the Kanchenjunga mountain range.

He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back. This palace is a five-story pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about 50 feet (15 m). The top three floors of the structure have the width of a single room, while the first and second floors have patios in front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the street, is like a honeycomb with small portholes. Each porthole has miniature windows and carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a mass of semi-octagonal bays, giving the monument its unique façade. The inner face on the back side of the building consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation, and reach up to the top floor. The interior of the palace has been described as ""having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding; while fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard.Visited on

Among the many landmarks that adorn this city, Jal Mahal stands out as a unique and captivating masterpiece. This review aims to delve into the intricate details, historical significance, architectural marvel, and overall experience of visiting Jal Mahal in Jaipur.**Introduction:**Jal Mahal, literally translated as the ""Water Palace,"" is a breathtaking palace located in the midst of the Man Sagar Lake, just outside Jaipur. Its picturesque setting amidst the tranquil waters makes it a sight to behold and an essential stop for any traveler exploring the city. The palace is a five-story structure, with four levels submerged in the lake's waters during the monsoon season, giving the illusion of floating on the lake.**Historical Significance:**Built during the 18th century, during the reign of Maharaja Madho Singh I, Jal Mahal was intended to serve as a leisure retreat for the royal family and their entourage. The palace's location in the center of the lake allowed for privacy and exclusivity, creating an oasis of serenity amidst the bustling city.**Architectural Marvel:**Jal Mahal seamlessly blends elements of Rajput and Mughal architectural styles, resulting in a harmonious and captivating design. The palace's lower levels are made of red sandstone, a hallmark of Rajput architecture, while the upper floors exhibit delicate Mughal-style ornamental work. This unique fusion of styles showcases the cultural synthesis that was prevalent during that era.**Design and Layout:**The palace's design is a symphony of intricate details and thoughtful planning. The chhatris (domed pavilions) on the rooftop are adorned with lotus motifs and elegantly carved jali (lattice) screens, allowing for ventilation and a play of light and shadow. The chhatri on the central dome is particularly impressive, acting as the crown jewel of the palace's design.**Natural Integration:**What truly sets Jal Mahal apart is its remarkable integration with the natural environment. The palace seems to rise organically from the lake's waters, with its reflection creating a mesmerizing mirror image on the still surface. The surrounding Aravalli hills and the lush greenery further enhance the ethereal beauty of the scene.**Conservation Efforts:**Over the years, Jal Mahal faced significant challenges due to environmental degradation and neglect. The lake's pollution and the deterioration of the palace's structure raised concerns about its survival. However, conservation efforts have been initiated to restore the palace to its former glory. This includes cleaning the lake, restoring the architectural elements, and implementing measures to control pollution.**Visitor Experience:**Visiting Jal Mahal is a sensory delight. The journey to the palace involves a leisurely drive through the bustling city, followed by a tranquil boat ride on the lake to reach the palace. The view of the palace against the backdrop of the Aravalli hills during sunrise or sunset is a sight that leaves a lasting impression. The palace isn't open to the public for exploration inside, but its exterior beauty and the surrounding scenery offer ample opportunities for photography and contemplation.**Cultural Significance:**Jal Mahal stands as a testament to Jaipur's architectural prowess and cultural heritage. It embodies the opulence and refinement of the bygone era, offering a glimpse into the extravagant lifestyle of the royals. The palace's location also serves as a reminder of the Maharajas' connection with nature and their ability to create harmonious retreats within the urban landscape.**Conclusion:**In conclusion, Jal Mahal is more than just a palace; it's a living testament to the creative genius of the architects of its time. Its blend of architectural styles, integration with nature, and historical significance make it a jewel in Jaipur's crown. A visit to Jal Mahal is an immersive experience that transpVisited on

The palace is one of the most popular attractions in Jaipur.The palace was originally intended to be a hunting lodge for the local king. However, in the 16th century, a severe drought caused the locals to build a dam, which created a lake that submerged the lower portions of the lodge. The palace's stone walls hold back millions of liters of water, and the specially designed lime mortar prevents water seepage into the palace. The palace's top floor is visible above the water, giving the impression that the palace is floating on the lake.The palace was commissioned by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in the early 18th century.Visited on

These caves are comparable in splendour to Ajanta and Ellora.It is located in the village of Karli, 10 KM from Lonavla, a hill station in Maharashtra, constructed during Satavahana's rule, between the 2nd century AD to the 5th century AD, by the Buddhist monks for meditation and worship.These well-known Buddhist rock-cut excavations consists of 16 caves that has one of the largest Caitya Griha in India, known as the Great Chaitya, with its apsidal chamber extending 124 feet into it, and a barrel-vaulted roof 46 feet high.  The chaitya griha is created with an amalgamation of timber and stone.  This chamber consists of a broad central nave with two narrow aisles on either side by a row of fifteen octagonal pillars.The entrance of the Karla Caves is gorgeous. You need to show the entry ticket at the gate. The strong rock cut representation of three Lion Pillars found at the entrance of the cave looks magnificent.There is a sculpture of Buddha preaching seated on a lion-supported throne, which has splendid carvings of three elephants. The pillars are adorned with motifs of elephants, men and riding women.There are Elephant Heads carved out of single stone with minute detailing. There are a few images and structures that are sadly broken by humans, yet they look exotic as ever.Entering the cave viharas through the little patch of tiny rock cut stairs is bit of a challenge, steps inside the cave are wet with rainwater and dark without light, one needs a torch. However, windows have also been built so that sunlight is allowed to penetrate in the hall. The door of the viharas are closed with barriers and prevented from entering.These caves are located just 3 km away from the main road amidst green surroundings.There are parking available uphill at the base of the cave but not enough to support the crowd on a Sunday. Road is steep and narrow with breathtaking view of the mountain and the valley. We drove up but there was a long jam closer to the base. We had to reverse slowly and park the vehicle halfway down by the road in a little broader space.There is also a waterfall near the cave where tourists can refresh themselves with a dip.Once you reach the base, it takes nearly 20 minutes to climb up the steep way approx. 500 steps to the Karla caves. The Aai Ekveera temple has been built recently at the entrance using pillars from the Buddhist period sharing the same premises.Visiting hour: 8:30 am to 5:00 pm on all days of the week.Entry fees is INR 5 for Indian citizens and INR 100 for foreigners.

This sacred site has drawn pilgrims, seekers, and curious travelers for centuries, and my recent visit left an indelible mark on my soul. Join me as I share my experiences and insights from my visit to the iconic Manikarnika Ghat.A Glimpse into History:Manikarnika Ghat is not just a place; it's a profound chapter in the rich history of Varanasi. Legends say that it was here that Lord Shiva's earring (Manikarnika) fell, hence the name. The ghat is also associated with the Great Cremation Ground, where Hindus believe that cremating the deceased leads to liberation from the cycle of reincarnation. As I approached, I was struck by the fusion of spirituality and mortality that permeates the air.The Rituals and Ceremonies:The heart of Manikarnika Ghat beats with the rhythm of rituals and ceremonies. I witnessed the continuous cremation pyres, each telling a story of a life lived and a soul on its journey to moksha (liberation). The sight was intense and thought-provoking, a reminder of the impermanence of life. The locals explained the rituals with reverence and grace, sharing their deep-rooted beliefs.The Aura of Spirituality:Walking through the labyrinthine alleys leading to the ghat, I was enveloped by the aura of spirituality. Sadhus and pilgrims clad in saffron robes wandered the streets, offering blessings and sharing their wisdom. The resonance of bells, the aroma of incense, and the constant chants created an otherworldly atmosphere that transported me to a realm beyond the physical.A Lesson in Acceptance:Manikarnika Ghat taught me the importance of embracing the inevitable cycle of life and death. It's a place where one can reflect on the impermanence of existence and the necessity of letting go. The acceptance of death as an integral part of life is a lesson that Manikarnika Ghat imparts with unparalleled depth.Conclusion:My visit to Manikarnika Ghat was a journey into the heart of spirituality, mortality, and the human experience. It's a place where life and death dance together in a sacred harmony that challenges our perception of the world. While it may not be an easy visit for everyone, it is undoubtedly a transformative one. Manikarnika Ghat stands as a timeless testament to the profound mysteries of existence, inviting all who come to contemplate the circle of life and death.In the end, my journey to Manikarnika Ghat left me with a sense of humility and a deep appreciation for the beauty and complexity of life. It's a destination that will forever remain etched in my memory, a place where the soul is stirred and the spirit finds solace.Nestled along the banks of the holy Ganges River in the spiritual city of Varanasi, Manikarnika Ghat stands as a timeless symbol of life, death, and rebirth in Hinduism.

You all are worst. You are treating Ganpatti Bappa as business. You people are also considering yourself bigger personality than devotees and the Ganpati Bappa himself. I imagine, very soon, Ganpati Bappa is going to punish you all for this unethical management and behavior. Your management inside and outside ""Garbha Griha"" is horrible.My mentioning here is my true experience with this temple which was really horrible. So, it's a humble request to all the devotees to go through my words first before coming to a conclusion. Obviously my words are going to justify my ratings and reviews for this temple.I was in the temple on the 7th day of the Ganpati Pooja. I reached in the temple with my family at around 8:45 PM when sufficient crowd was already in queue. The queue was not too long and also not too short. We opted to go in the 100/- Rs. paid line. We took the ticket and reached near to the Garbh Griha.The actual incident started at that moment. At the gate both, paid and non-paid queues were merged. People were rushing for the darshan of Bappa. They were ready to insult women, also were looking ready to crush small kids. Only their moto was to collect the  bappa maximum as they can. Facing all the chalenges, we reached near for darshan, surrendered our prashad and pushp to the pandit jee. It was hardly a second or two, when the security personal started throwing us out of the Garbh Grih. Luckily I was third. So, before me he pushed a lady and a gents. That lady became very angry and she was about to ""offer a slap"" to that security personal because he pushed at her breast. This was witnessed by my wife.He was saved because continuously he was pushing the people, so as she turned back she observed three men and a lady in between her and the security personal. Then she shouted with her ease. And this way that security was saved.In all this incident, we were not able to see Ganpati Bappa for a moment at least. We ignored the incident, and thought to take blessings from outside the Garbha Griha. But we were wrong, another security personal was standing who was more rude than the first one. Immediately we requested him just to allow for a second to have a look for Ganpati Bappa. But he was not ready to listen a single word.Finally, on this very important day, we remembered Ganpati Bappa in our heart and surrendered ourselves because we tried our best for the blessings.""Observation for 100/- Queue"" :Useless to pay, because near to ""Garbha Griha"", they merge all free and paid line together. Both the queues take almost same time.""Observation inside the Gabha Griha"":Security personal are rude enough and do misconduct with women too when they observe rush.""Observation for Darshan"":Security inside the Garbh Griha are in extra hurry irrespective of the crowd. They are ready to throw everyone out without delay as they enter.""Peace in The Temple"":It can be best defined in the terms of business.""And at the Last Again"":वक्रतुण्ड महाकाय, सूर्यकोटि समप्रभ ।निर्विघ्नं कुरु मे देव, सर्वकार्येषु सर्वदा ॥Visited on

After taking the boat, there is a toy train to the foot of the caves after which we would have to climb the stairs. Climbing the stairs was very difficult since it was very steep. Wear shoes because there is a lot to walk. If you are genuinely interested in history, then this is the right place for you. For us, we were a little bored since the caves were all repetitive and looked the same, nothing to see inside. Just plain caves with empty rooms. 2-3 hours sufficient to see around. Beware of monkeys. They are everywhere and try to steal your food and belongings. There is an entry fee of 40 and an extra ₹5 for tax. Closing time is 5:30 after which there is no boat from the caves to Gateway. Plenty of restaurants nearby. Carry a water bottle and cap since you'll get dehydrated and tired from all the walking. Overall, a different and new experience.Visited on

Mosto visitors would go directly for Kanheri caves. You could either take a bus to the caves or rent a cycle on hourly basis and ride along the beautiful greenery of the National park to reach kanheri caves. Its around 5kms with some steep climbs and curves, so make sure you have the energy to cycle for half an hour on a climb. It definitely gets quite tiring by the time you reach the caves. The road to caves is real beautifull and You'd definitely enjoy the ride.They have cycles inside the park to rent as well as You'd find many private cycle outside the park's entrance to rent. Do negotiate the hours and make sure you get at least 4hrs as It'll at least take you 4 hrs to explore the park and kanheri caves.Make sure to rest before exploring the caves as well.

One last thing: this place should have a 5-star average, but the only reason it doesn't, is that, after reading the reviews, there seem to be a whole bunch of Indian tourists who wouldn't recognise a piece of peaceful and CLEAN nature if it bit them in the face. I feel quite sad for them. They just need to stay in their polluted, rubbish-filled cities and leave the nice parts of India to people who might appreciate them. Everyone wins!This desert park rewilding is a breath of fresh air - literally, in the hubbub of Jodhpur. It's probably also the cleanest few square kilometres of India, and even some quiet spots where you can barely hear the humanity lurking nearby. ",positive

However, the temple itself provided a serene and devoted atmosphere that made up for it.Inside the main temple, a continuous kirtan was underway, offering a soothing and meditative environment. Joining in and sitting for a while allowed me to relax my mind and body, immersing myself in the peaceful and spiritual ambiance.As I exited the temple, there were plenty of gift shops and snack centers, serving decent food. Moreover, there were many book stalls outside the main temple, providing an opportunity to explore spiritual literature.In summary, the ISKCON temple visit during the weekends is a must for those seeking to enjoy Krishna consciousness, despite some waiting.

1364,0.019,0.872,0.109,0.9957,Khajuraho,Kandariya Mahadeva Temple,"This is a Hindu temple called the Kandariya Mahadeva, the largest and tallest of the surviving temples at the temple site of Khajuraho, in central India. It is dedicated to Shiva, who is represented by the linga in the main shrine known as the womb chamber located at the heart of the building.Hindu temples are designed along axis points that extend from the heart of the chamber upward through the line of the main tower (shikara) and outward in the cardinal directions. The main deity image is located in the central shrine, and the outside of the shrine and the exterior of the temple are richly decorated with sculptures. In some design schemes, one views the entire range of existence looking upwards from bottom to top, with plant and animal life near the bottom and the gods and semi-divine beings in various sculptural registers extending towards the heavens at the temple’s summit. The steeply rising superstructure, and overall mountainous form of this temple are references to the mythical source of creation, the primordial Mount Meru, around which the world came into being.The Khajuraho temples sit on very large platforms, and it is thought that originally there may have been a lake here beneath them. An association between temple sites and water is appropriate, as an essential part of Hindu worship is ritual bathing, required by the devout in order to purify themselves before entering the sacred area of the temple.The majority of Hindu temples in north and central India were built between the Gupta period (roughly 300–700 CE) and the 1100s. The temples at Khajuraho are considered among the highpoints of classical Hindu architecture in the northern (nagara) style . This temple and more than 80 others were built by the Chandella kings, who ruled this area of central India between 950–1050 CE. Some temples, such as those at Khajuraho, survived because they were located in remote locations, removed from the conflict and warfare of political and urban centers. Even today, one must fly to Khajuraho, or take a full-day car ride from any other major city center.Some of the earliest Hindu temples were carved out of living rock and freestanding stone temples evolved gradually after that. Western-style arches and vaults were never used, but masons carved fine sandstone in numerous pieces, which were then assembled and sometimes pinned together using metal rods.The Khajuraho temples are famous around the world for their fine statuary, many of which depict loving couples, sometimes in erotic poses. These images were disturbing to early European visitors, and even now confound many viewers. Scholars debate the meaning of these images, offering multiple explanations. One interpretation is that they show tantric ritual symbolism. “Tantric” refers to esoteric texts and techniques used in both Hindu and Buddhist practices that offer a direct path to enlightenment or spiritual release using the body’s natural energies as a starting point. Thus, physical pleasure, and more specifically a controlled experience of physical pleasure, could be a path to spiritual achievement. Such imagery may also challenge to the viewer to move beyond the earthly experience of physical pleasure into higher spiritual goals. The location of these loving couples on the temple walls, between the meeting hall portion of the temple and the inner sanctum, seems critical to their interpretation.Various esoteric and mainstream texts describe sexual activities and postures, including the comprehensively categorical Kama Sutra. It is likely that these erotic sculptures take such texts as the source of their subject matter. Aesthetically, these sculptures are highly sophisticated, expressing virtuosity in their rendering of human figures, expression and interaction, and an extremely imaginative vision of physical acrobatics.Har Har MahadevJai Shiv SankarJai Hind Jai Bharat 🇮🇳Wait time

Although Sati felt insulted when her father did not invite Shiva to the ritual, she attended the yajna. She found that Shiva was being spurned by her father and she burnt herself in the Yajna Kunda itself. Shiva got angry and sent his Gaṇas, the terrible Virabhadra and Bhadrakali to the ritual.[3] On the direction of Shiva, Virabhadra appeared with Shiva's ganas in the midst of Daksha's assembly like a storm wind and waged a fierce war with the gods and mortals present culminating in the beheading of Daksha, who was later given the head of a goat at the behest of Brahma and other gods.If you are traveling to Haridwar, you can never miss visiting the Daksha Temple as it occupies a significant place in the Hindu mythology.Visited on

Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati is considered to be the highest point of pride of Pune city. Every year countless devotees from all over India and abroad come to have darshan of this Lord.Shri Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati This temple is not only a place of respect and devotion for the devotees, but not only this, but people also know it as an important institution which is striving for social service and culture promotion. This organization is working under the name 'Shri Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Mandir Trust'. There is a very big and glorious tradition behind this temple.Srimant Dagdusheth and his wife Lakshmibai had established this Ganesh idol after losing their only son to plague many years ago. After that, every year not only the family of Shri Dagdusheth but also all the people around kept celebrating Ganeshotsav with great devotion and enthusiasm. At that time, in his young age, Tatyasaheb Godse was an enthusiastic worker of this Ganesh Utsav. Later, when Lokmanya Tilakji made Ganeshotsav a public festival to gather people in the freedom struggle, Dagdusheth Ganapati got the honor of most popularity.In 1952, the responsibility of discipline of Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati temple festival fell on Tatyasaheb and his friends and family. Under the guidance of Tatyasaheb, his associates Mamasaheb Rasane, Ed. Mister. Shankarrao Suryavanshi and Shri. Of. D. Rasane, these people performed this responsibility very well and after that this sequence never stopped. Generous donors and devotees kept donating generously in the donation box of the temple. Then Tatyasaheb and his friends and family thought, what could be a greater service to God than serving one's own relatives with this fund? Inspired by this goal, these youth stepped into the field of social and cultural development by taking the festive rituals beyond the tradition of worship. The religious activities performed in the temple continued with full pomp and show, but he also turned his attention towards the social and political issues of his state.Through 'Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Mandir Trust', he started many social works.

The caves have been cut out from a monolithic basalt rock. The cave has a temple complex dedicated to Shiv Ji and a circular ‘Mandapa’ for Nandi Ji. Although there are 3 sanctums in the temple which are said to be of Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh each, the 2 sanctums had their statues lost during the course of their history and later were said to be reclaimed in the 19th century. Presently Shivling is in the central sanctum and the rest of the 2 sanctums are now also dedicated to Parvati Ji and Ganesh Ji.Pataleshwar Caves entrance gate is a ‘blink & miss’ on the right side of the JM Road while on a vehicle. Since JM Road is a one way road, look at your right for Sadguru Jangali Maharaja Samadhi Mandir. Just next to the Mandir you’ll find the Pataleshwar caves entrance gate. Enter the gate and you’ll find a tall good old charm - a Bargad Tree 🌳 - welcoming you with numerous dangling roots and branches.Pataleshwar Caves are the oldest (8th Century) man-made structures in Pune. And we have always overlooked its history, its importance and its grandness. Do visit with friends and family to understand why it has been designated as a monument of National Importance by the ASI.Do not miss ! Entry is free for all !Visited on

But all of these still remain a mystery and there are many caves yet to be dug up. The place is being maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and is a representation of the city’s heritage.For anyone who gets hypnotised by the structure and ancient architecture, this place will knock your socks off. Astonishingly, the cave has been carved out of single basalt rock and you can find fine craftsmanship and delicate carving on all of these structures.

Also the path to kulam(pond), where the lead actors in the movie are seen running around. This place closes at 4:30 p.m. probably to avoid running into Nagavalli at night 😜Now coming to history, this was the official residence and administrative office of the Cochin Maharaja. The palace is spread in an area of 50 plus acres. By the size of the palace you can imagine what a royal and luxurious lifestyle the Royal family people who lived in the palace would have had.The palace has been converted into a museum by the archaeology department. The museum is filled with lot of pictures and details about history of Kochi, its rulers, invaders, its people, its trade and culture. If you are a history lover, you can definitely spend a whole day here.The artifacts include the crown and various jewelry of the Royal Family. These are preserved in a separate room with security and no filming is allowed here. Other than these you can find ivory idols, sceptres, photographs, huge chariots, palanquin, and Kerala State's first elevator among many others.There are adequate staff at every nook and corner to guide you and give you details of what you are seeing.There is a small deer park behind the palace.The palace/museum is well maintained. There are some staircases and rooms which are locked and entry restricted.The palace is huge that you would get tired walking through and there is no place to rest or even chairs provided to sit during your tour of the place (a drawback for the elderly). Another MAJOR issue is that you have to leave your footwear in a cloak room beside the palace and the walk back barefoot; on hot days, you'll definitely to get blisters on the sole of your feet (you're getting punished   )The entry fee is meager including parking and for mobile photography. There is plenty of parking available. There is a small canteen near the deer park, which is very unhygenic (especially the juice counter).I liked the experience except the punishment of walking barefoot.Visited on

The ashram staff and volunteers are very helpful and friendly, and they conduct various activities and events to promote Gandhi’s values and teachings. I attended a Gandhi Katha, a storytelling session about Gandhi’s life, which was very informative and inspiring. I also enjoyed the Sabarmati Lecture series, where eminent speakers discussed various topics related to Gandhi and contemporary issues.

Do not take the Horse rides available as they are pretty boring and chances are you have to sit on the horse under the sun in clear skies.Buta Pathri is located approximately 4km ahead of the Gulmarg Gold club. To reach this place you need to take a union cab. We paid ₹1000 per person for a cab for 6 people. The driver needs to take a permit for entering the army area. The process of taking a permit and then getting the entry approved took around 1 and a half hours. Also these permits are time bound and you only get 2 hours to go and come back from Buta Pathri. After the entry you will go to 3 different points: Nagin pt 1,2 and Buta Pathri. Nagin points are very scenic and you will get good pictures here.Adventure activities like sledge rides and assisted skiing are also available at Nagin points.Buta Pathri only has a small stream of water and the famous Jab Tak Hai Jaan bridge.Overall it's a decent alternative to enjoy snow in gulmarg if you don't have the gondola ride tickets.Visited on

As I made my way from Tatanagar to Gaya, anticipation and excitement coursed through me, knowing that I was about to witness the remarkable Mahabodhi temple, the place where Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment.Upon my arrival at Bodhgaya, I was immediately struck by the sense of tranquility that enveloped the surroundings. The Mahabodhi temple stood tall and majestic, exuding an aura of divinity and peace. Stepping into its sacred premises, I couldn't help but feel a profound sense of reverence and awe. The air was filled with a sense of spirituality and devotion, as pilgrims from all walks of life paid their respects to the enlightened one.One of the most captivating aspects of my visit was the Buddhist tree, known as the Bodhi tree, situated within the temple complex. This revered tree, under which Buddha himself meditated, emanated an energy that seemed to transcend time. Sitting in its shade, I closed my eyes and allowed myself to immerse in a deep meditation, connecting with the same serenity that Buddha must have experienced centuries ago.What made my experience even more enriching was the diverse array of visitors from across the globe. I encountered fellow travelers from the Philippines, Thailand, China, and Japan, all drawn to Bodhgaya for its spiritual significance. It was fascinating to witness people from different cultures and backgrounds come together in their quest for inner peace and enlightenment. Conversations flowed effortlessly, as we exchanged stories, insights, and cultural knowledge, forging connections that transcended linguistic and national boundaries.As I explored the temple complex further, my eyes were drawn to the magnificent 80-feet Buddha statue, an emblem of wisdom and compassion. Its sheer size and intricate details left me in awe, and I couldn't help but marvel at the craftsmanship that brought this symbol of enlightenment to life. The statue, with its serene expression and dignified posture, served as a constant reminder of the teachings of Buddha and the path towards liberation.In my time at Bodhgaya, I not only found solace and tranquility but also gained a deeper understanding of Buddhist philosophy and its universal appeal. The city's vibrant cultural tapestry, influenced by the presence of international visitors, further enriched my experience. Exchanging ideas, rituals, and traditions with individuals from different corners of the world broadened my perspective and fostered a greater appreciation for our shared humanity.Leaving Bodhgaya, I felt a profound sense of gratitude for the opportunity to immerse myself in such a spiritually significant place. The memories of my visit continue to resonate within me, reminding me of the importance of finding moments of stillness and reflection amidst the chaos of everyday life. Bodhgaya, with its Mahabodhi temple, the Bodhi tree, and the 80-feet Buddha statue, holds a timeless allure that beckons all seekers of peace and enlightenment.Visited on

Apart from entry fee, one can take their own car (or cab) inside, and it’s charged Rs.750. Alternatively one can opt for battery powered vehicles - on per seat Rs.70 Basis or a 10 seater on Rs.700 or 6-7 seater on Rs.560. We opted the last one.Good part of hiring a battery powered vehicle is the driver takes you to the important spots using optimal route - and they finish just within an hour. They’re good storyteller too!I loved everything about the zoo. Collection, organization, care, tourist amenities - everything. Only complaint will be that the gift shop is somewhat inside the park, however the vehicles leave you back at the gate, and one gets tired and don’t go back to the shop even if he/she want to buy souvenirs.Great zoo, will visit again if there are opportunities.Visited on

The whole description of how the cave was found when a cow fell through the hole at the top and the search by the herder leading to the discovery is described at the front entrance. To reach this location, you can either take a vehicle from Araku Valley Town or you can start from the Borra Guhalu Station. From the Borra Guhalu station, you can walk around 400-500 meters to the entrance. It is my duty to caution you that the road is undulated and walking will put stress on the knees. First you will come across a taxi stand beyond which no big vehicle can surpass. After this, there will be small shops on either side of the road to the ticket counter. The ticket price is minimal, it may change season wise. There is a UPI payment facility at the ticket counter making it easier for the tourists. Outside the entrance, you will have a free lavatory, for men and women. The entrance starts and you will have to take the steps and walkway downhill. There will be one point where there is a view of the valley with the Gosthani Rover flowing. Further down, you will find the big entrance. At the entrance there is also a small temple. From the entrance it's all downhill. You will come to separate levels, which are all connected by stairs. There will be locations at which water from above will be dropping. The cave is lit with coloured lights which illuminates the cave and gives it a different vibe. There are several locations where you can take pictures. There will be sections where you will have to pass under huge rocks. There will be ample stalagmite and stalactites. One thing to be reminded of is that the floor is slippery and make sure you wear proper shoes. One location is of a Lingam, which was converted to a Shiva Temple by locals. The stairs here are very steep and you will have to wear good gripping shoes. It is a must visit for anyone.Visited on

However, my experience was somewhat hindered by the challenging journey to reach the beach. The road leading to Yarada Beach passes through picturesque mountains, but it appeared that maintenance has been lacking, as plants have overgrown onto the road.It's my sincere hope that the transportation ministry takes notice of this issue and undertakes the necessary measures to clear the roads of the overgrown vegetation. The road to Yarada Beach is a two-way zone with just a single lane, which can be quite challenging to navigate, especially when there's oncoming traffic. By addressing this concern, the authorities could significantly improve the accessibility and safety of this route.Moreover, I couldn't help but imagine the potential for Yarada Beach as a prominent tourist destination. If the government were to invest in creating new viewpoints along the way, it could enhance the overall experience for visitors. These viewpoints would not only provide breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape but also serve as resting spots for travelers to appreciate the natural beauty of the area.In summary, Yarada Beach is undeniably a hidden gem on the Vizag coast, boasting incredible natural beauty. However, there is room for improvement in terms of road maintenance and infrastructure development to make it more accessible and enjoyable for tourists.

Rama is sentenced to a 14-year exile into the jungles, and he eventually spends many years in Panchavati, a region in what is now Nashik, Maharashtra. Within this place is the Cave of Sita, where it is said that the evil king of Lanka, Ravana, kidnapped Sita.The cave today is a popular place for pilgrims who travel to Panchavati to get closer to the legend of the Ramayana. Located near the five sacred banyan trees in the area, you can enter the cave through the narrow staircase leading into it.

This thing is mentioned in the Avanti section of Skanda Purana. Maratha influence is visible on the present Kaal Bhairav ​​temple.The statues of Shiva, Parvati, Vishnu and Ganesha dating from the Parmar reign (9th to 13th century) have been found at this place. At one time the walls of this temple were decorated with Malwa paintings. But now only some parts of those paintings are visible.According to the people here, after the Maratha defeat in the third battle of Panipat (1761), Maratha General Mahadji Shinde had offered his turban to Lord Kaal Bhairav ​​to establish power in North India by leading the Maratha Empire to victory. So that they can win the battle.And later, after the Maratha victory, Mahadji Shinde increased the construction work of the temple.There has been a long debate about what is the secret behind Kaal Bhairav's drinking. Rajul Maharaj, who has been serving this temple for generations, says that during his grandfather's time, a British officer had got the temple thoroughly inspected. But he could not find anything...he even got the area around the statue excavated, but the results were disappointing. After that he also became a devotee of Kaal Bhairav. After him, the local liquor started being pronounced as wine here, which continues till today.After sitting in the temple for a long time and inspecting the surrounding places and talking to many knowledgeable people, we were fully convinced that where there is faith, there is no scope for doubt.Wait time

The biggest feature of this temple is that here the idol of Lord Kalabhairav ​​is offered liquor.The surprising thing is that in no time the vessel in which alcohol is offered becomes empty. Where this liquor goes, this mystery remains even today. Every day a crowd of devotees throng here and see this miracle with their own eyes.While offering liquor to Kalabhairav, our attitude should be that we dedicate all our evils to God and resolve to walk on the path of goodness. Liquor i.e. Sura is also a form of Shakti. This power should not be consumed. The person who consumes it becomes misguided.According to the priest of the temple, the description of this temple is found in the Avanti Khanda of Skandapurana. The Vaishnava form of Lord Kalabhairava is worshiped in this temple.Many legends related to this temple are also popular. According to which Lord Mahakal, the king of Ujjain, has appointed Kalbhairav ​​to protect the city at this place. That's why Kalbhairav ​​is also called Kotwal of the city.About a decade ago, construction work was done on the outside to strengthen the temple building. For this construction, about 12-12 feet deep excavation was done around the temple.The purpose of this excavation was to renovate the temple, but many people used to reach here to see this excavation. Everyone wanted to know that when Kalbhairav ​​consumes alcohol, where does that alcohol go.To calm this curiosity, many people came during the excavation work, but nothing was found in the excavation, which could solve this question of the people.There are many legends about this temple such that many scientists came to know the secret of this temple, but they too could not know the reason behind this miracle.The temple of Lord Kalabhairav ​​is built at some distance from the main city. This place is famous by the name of Bhairavgarh. The temple of Kalabhairav ​​is built on a high mound, around which a parkota (wall) is built. It is believed that the temple building was renovated about a thousand years ago by the Parmar kings. Only the old materials of the temple were used for this construction work. The temple was built by joining big stones.

The monument honors Adinath, Mahavira, Neminath, and Rishabhanatha, four Jain Tirthankaras, whose statues can be seen in meditative positions. They are one of 100 monuments that are spread across the city.Gopachal Mountain is situated in the area of ​​Gwalior Fort in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. This place is famous for its groups of Jain sculptures. Thousands of huge Digambara Jain statues were carved from the mountain here between 1398 and 1536. These huge statues were built during the reign of kings Veeramdev, Dungarsingh and Kirtisingh of Tomar dynasty.Jain pilgrimage siteGopachal Mountain gives the message of non-violence to the universe and complete abolition of the practice of sacrifice in Hindu religion. Statues of Tirthankaras of Jainism who reformed the stereotypes and ostentation have been made here. Statues ranging from six inches to 57 feet were also made in these. These statues also include the Bavanagaja statues of Lord 'Adinath' (Rishabhdev) and the Padmasana statues of Lord Parshvanath. Gwalior Fort is a Jain pilgrimage from the point of view of Jain idols, hence this hill is also known as Jaingarh.[1]legendsIt is a legend that contrary to the reverence and devotion with which Dungar Singh had nurtured Jainism, Sher Shah Suri broke these idols on the mountain and got them disintegrated. He himself once picked up a sword to break the statue of Parshvanath, but at that time he lost the strength in his arms. Frightened by this miracle, Sher Shah ran away from there. Later, Mughal Emperor Akbar removed the statue of Chandraprabh and buried the body of 'Mohammed Ghaus', who helped Babar's army, there, which is today called 'Mohammad Ghaus's tomb'. The proof of this can be found in these lines of the great poet Khadgaraya-Vidhina Vidhi was given like this, Soi Bhai Ju Aayi,The cowherds of Lord Indra may attain happiness.Jain proven area Gopachal, which is at the foothills of the historical fort of Gwalior and Jain statues are carved throughout the rocky area of ​​the fort. The size of the carved statues ranges from 6 inches to 57 feet in height and their number is not just one or two but more than one and a half thousand. Because of these statues, the fort of Gwalior looks like a temple.Thousands of huge Digambara Jain statues were carved here between 1398 and 1536 by carving the mountain of the fort. These huge statues were built during the reign of kings Veeramdev, Dungarsingh and Kirtisingh of Tomar dynasty. , These statues also include Bavanagaja statues of Lord 'Adinath' (Rishabhdev) and Padmasana statues of Lord Parsvanath. Therefore this hill is also known as Jaingarh.Tourists are surprised to see these centuries-old ancient statues, because carving out a mountain and making statues is not an easy task. Apart from this, these statues have been enduring dust, rain and sunlight for many centuries. Despite facing so many natural disasters, these statues are still seen giving the message of non-violence.Gopal Parvat / Gopachal Parvat Gwalior

The temple was expanded during the 12th century by the Pandya Dynasty, and its principal shrine’s sanctum was renovated by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan and his successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan, monarchs of the Jaffna kingdom. The temple has the longest corridor among all Hindu temples in India. It was built by King Muthuramalinga Sethupathiy. [1] [2] The temple, located in Rameswaram, is considered a holy pilgrimage site for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and Smarthas. Mythological accounts depict the presiding deity, the Lingam of Ramanathaswamy (Shiva), as having been established and worshiped by Rama, before he crossed his bridge to the present-day island of Sri Lanka.

And She is the Kaliyugi Avatar of Kalika. Additionally, she is seen as the potency of Hari or Vishnu.History of Vaishno MataThe temple of Mata Vaishno Devi is very ancient according to the study conducted by the geologists. Legend has it that Mata Vaishno Devi had incarnated as a beautiful princess in Treta Yuga as a Shakti of Mother Parvati, Saraswati and Lakshmi for the welfare of mankind. She performed penances in the cave on Trikuta Mountain. When the time came, her body merged into the astral form of the three divine energies – Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati.Her ardent devotee – ShridharOf all the popular legends of Mata Vaishno Devi, the most recent one is that of her ardent devotee, Shridhar, who lived about seven centuries ago. Shridhar and his wife were very devoted to the Mother Goddess. Once, Shridhar received a divine command in his dream to organise a bhandhara (public feast) in Her honour. Owing to his humble financial status, Shridhar failed to procure sufficient groceries for the public feast. He worried about the shame and guilt he shall be subject for failing to feed the guests the following day. Unable to sleep a wink the whole night, Shridhar resigned himself to destiny. As the sun rose in the firmament, villagers began arriving at the modest dwelling of Shridhar to partake of the feast. To Shridhar’s surprise, Goddess Vaishnavi appeared in his hut in the form of a little girl and by Her Will, the feast was prepared and served to the villagers. The villagers had their fill of the food except Bhairon Nath, who was one of the guests. When he demanded a meal of animal meal from Shridhar, Vaishno Mata refused to oblige Bhairon Nath on Shridhar’s behalf. Refusing to accept defeat and insult, Bhairon tried to catch hold of the divine girl, but failed to do so. Lo and behold! The girl vanished. This incident left other shocked, and Shridhar grief-stricken. He longed and pined to have darshan of His Mother. One night, Vaishno Mata appeared in Shridhar’s dream and showed him a way to a cave on Trikuta Mountain which houses her ancient shrine. Shridhar gladly did as told, discovered the holy shrine and devoted his life to her service. Later, the word spread everywhere about the shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi.Vaishno MataAccording to the holy writ, before the great war between the Kurus and the Pandavas was about to begin in Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna advised Arjuna to worship Goddess Durga to obtains her grace. During his prayers, Arjun Arjun addresses the Divine Mother as ‘Jambookatak Chityaishu Nityam Sannihitalaye’, which translates into ‘you who always dwell in the temple on the slope of the mountain in Jamboo’ (‘Jamboo’ comes from Jamboodweep, also refers to, India and its surrounding lands in ancient times). Pleased with his devotion, the Divine Mother grants Arjun the boon of victory over his enemies. It is also believed that the Pandavas have visited the shrine of Vaishno Devi on Trikuta mountain.The divine call…It is a belief held in sacred regard by the devotees of Divine Mother that unless She beckons you to visit her, it is impossible to have her darshan. The bulawa (or Divine Call) to receive blessings of the Mother is all that is needed and the rest will be taken care of by Her. Therefore, high or low, wise or ignorant, men or women await Her bulawa.The way to the shrine…Pilgrims and ardent devotees of the Mother Goddess brave the arduous 24 kilometre long trek (to and fro) to reach the shrine that is always brimming with overwhelming divine vibrations. The journey to the shrine starts at Ban Ganga in Katra which is believed to have sprung up from the earth when Vaishno Mata shot up an arrow from her divine bow many centuries ago.

J C Chaudhry. Spread across 12 acres of land, the Dham provides an opportunity to all the devotees of Maa Vaishno Devi to worship their goddess and serve the poor alongside. Every year lakhs of devotees visit the Dham from all parts of India and abroad.Sh. J C Chaudhry is the Managing Trustee and the founder of Maa Vaishno Devi Dham at Vrindavan. With a staunch belief in Maa Vaishno Devi, whom he always considers as a source of support and inspiration, Sh. J C Chaudhry established the Dham to reciprocate to the Goddess for all her love, care, and blessings.In 2013, Limca Book of Records recognized the magnificent Maa Vaishno Devi Murti as the tallest statue (141 feet in height) in India.His idea of a dedicated Dham for devotees, however, could not have been completed without the magnificent Maa Vaishno Murti, (standing at an impressive height of 141ft from ground level), Devi Mandir, Darshan Gufa, Bhojanalaya, Free Dispensary, Atithi Niwas, Spiritual Hall, Meditation Hall, Yoga Hall, and Library etc.In his quest to reciprocate to the Goddess for all her love, care, and blessings, Sh. Chaudhry built the Maa Vaishno Dham. The location of Dham is holy as Vrindavan is the place where Lord Krishna observed his childhood.This grand contribution by Sh. Chaudhry is his endeavour to relinquish it back to society through his religious involvements. Sh. Chaudhry is a philanthropist who has always believed in making a difference through his noble pursuits. He has set a number of precedents through his community building ventures and Maa Vaishno Devi Dham is one of them.Maa Vaishno Devi is believed to grant four boons to her devotees namely Dharma (Righteousness), Artha (Material Pursuits), Kaama (Contentment), and Moksha (Enlightenment).

There is a grand temple in the middle of Seva Kunj covered with creeper leaves, in which Shri Krishna is seated in a very beautiful form, pressing the feet of Radha ji. Pictures of Radha ji's friends Lalita and others are also enhancing the beauty of the temple. Along with this, Lalita Vishakha ji is also visible.There is Lalita-Kund in Seva Kunj. Where during Raas, when Lalita ji felt thirsty, Krishna dug a beautiful pond with his Venu (vanshi). Lalita ji had taken refreshment from its cool sweet water along with her friends. There is a concrete platform in the middle of Seva Kunj, it is a rumor that even today Rasleela is performed here every night.History of Seva Kunj:Vrindavan is the personal abode of Shyama Ju and Shri Kunj Vihari. Here the stream of love of Radha-Krishna keeps flowing. It is believed that the eternally beloved always remains engaged in pilgrimage in Shri Dham Vrindavan.Devotee Raskhan searched for Krishna everywhere in Braj and got lost, finally it was here only here that he saw Rasik Krishna. He has described that tableau in his post as follows -Look, Durya, that grove in the cottage.Sityo palotat Radhika Payan.There is a bed in the temple for sleeping, about which it is said that even today Priya Pritam rests on it in physical form at night. Also, there is a concrete platform in the middle of Seva Kunj, the people of Braj say that even today Shri Radha Krishna-couple walk here in person every night.No one can see this Vihar Leela, thousands of monkeys, birds and animals stay in Seva Kunj throughout the day, but as soon as evening comes, all the animals and monkeys automatically leave Seva Kunj and not even a bird stays there again.Even the underground creatures like ants etc. go underground. No one can see Raas Leela because Raas Leela is not the Leela of this worldly world. Raas is the ""Supreme Divine Divine Leela"" of the supernatural world. No ordinary person or The living being cannot see with its eyes. The great saints have heard the sound of Radharani ji and the chanting of Gopis from Seva Kunj.When Radha Rani ji gets tired while performing the Raas, Bihari ji presses her feet. And they sleep at night, even today there is a bed in the bedroom where the priest keeps a vessel of water, paan, datun, laddu, flower and prasad, and when the door is opened in the morning, the water is yellow, paan is chewed, datun is found. It is found cooked and the flower bed is found buried and all the flowers are scattered.Say Jai Seva Kunj Dham.""Seva Kunj or Nikunj Forest""

From the moment we arrived on a sunny morning, the temple greeted us with its serene ambiance and breathtaking beauty.To begin with, reaching the temple was a breeze as there was a convenient bus service available that took us all the way to the top. This thoughtful provision made the journey hassle-free for our group of 12 family members, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the spiritual adventure that awaited us.Upon reaching the top, we were captivated by the awe-inspiring panoramic view that unfolded before our eyes. The picturesque scenery surrounding the temple, with lush greenery and majestic hills, created a sense of tranquility that instantly put us at ease.The priests at the temple deserve special mention for their warm and welcoming nature. They guided us through the rituals and provided insightful information about the temple's history and significance. Their genuine devotion and dedication added to the sacred atmosphere of the place, making our visit even more meaningful.One aspect that stood out during our visit was the temple's impeccable cleanliness. The entire premises were well-maintained, reflecting the devotion and respect for the divine space. It was truly a pleasure to explore the temple's various sections, all of which exuded a sense of serenity and purity.As we embarked on this spiritual journey, we were filled with a profound sense of peace and positivity. The Temple provided us with an opportunity to connect with the divine in a meaningful way, leaving a lasting impression on our hearts and minds.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend visiting the Marudhamalai Arulmigu Subramanya Swami Temple to anyone seeking a spiritual retreat in Coimbatore.

Most of the monuments built by the Nawabs of Awadh portray a rich blend of Mughal, British, and Persian architecture at its best. One such magnificent structure, which unfortunately could not reach completion, is the #Satkhanda, situated in the Hussainabad area of the city.The tower was built by Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah in 1842. Originally, the plan was to build 30 meters high, seven-storey tower but the construction work was abandoned after the untimely death of Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah. By that time, only four storeys could be completed. The tower is approximately 21 meters high and was built to view the moon by the Ulema as Muslims celebrate Eid, Bakreed  festivals according to the sighting of the moon. Moreover, Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah wanted to have an extensive bird’s eye view of the wonderful city of Lucknow along with the majestic monuments and buildings from Satkhanda.According to some local historians, the Nawab used to love his daughter immensely and wanted to build the monument for her. Unfortunately, the Nawab’s daughter is said to have died at a tender age. Soon after the untimely death of his daughter, Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah also died as he was unable to bear the loss of his daughter. The construction of the Satkhanda tower was abruptly stopped after the death of Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah and the descendants of the Nawab did not undertake the completion of the construction because they thought it would be a bad omen. Some locals believe that Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah hurt his ankle badly while climbing the stairs of the tower and died soon after this incident. Perhaps, this was the reason behind the reluctance of the Nawab’s descendants to avoid resuming the construction of Satkhanda, considering it a bad omen.#Lucknow #HometownThe old city area of Lucknow is replete with historical monuments so much so that it seems to be taken straight out of a history book.

It is built in the Italian Renaissance Revival architecture style[1] and once had a 20-acre rose garden, while its main gates are modelled after those at the Buckingham Palace, by Triggs of Calcutta.After the death of Tukojirao Holkar III in 1978, his third wife, an American, Sharmishtha Devi (formerly Nancy Anne Miller) moved out and subsequently, the palace was converted into a museum.
